Hello everyone,

This web app didn't have a "404" page. So I decided to make a new one. But unfortunately, I am not a good front-end developer. 

I got inspire from Picasso; "Good artists borrow, great artists steal." Do not afraid I didn't steal. I just borrow the opinion. And I will share the original copy of that source code, don't worry. But before that, let's look at the modified by me. You can try it below;

You can see the "404" page. You can borrow it from my Github project. The file called as "_error.js" is into the pages folder.  Indeed, Next.js has got an error page as a default and you can override it with creating new _error.js file into the pages folder. You can find my GitHub repo below;

You can access the original "404" page below;

We will continue to improve this page together and I will share every new improvement with you on this blog.

I hope we'll learn together.

Take care, bye.
