Every developer knows the meaning of "Hello World". So, I want to start blogging like this.

In this first article, you will find the heart of this web app. Yes, you read that correctly! Itâ€™s a web app as the webpage which you are reading now is a PWA. So, you can add a shortcut of this page to the Home screen of your mobile phone and then view it later in offline mode!

Here is a link to the source code which was used for the app: 
https://github.com/ngeen/nextjs-mdx-blog-kit

It is a modified version of the nextjs-mdx-blog-kit project, and I created it by adding the [Bulma Css libary](https://bulma.io) along with the [Devicons](https://konpa.github.io/devicon/) and [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) icon libraries. You can take a look at the libraries by clicking on the names.

If you need the original project, you can find it here: 
https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/nextjs-mdx-blog-kit

When I forked this project from the original, there was a little bug with creating a page or post. If the problem continues when you fork from the original, you can fix it by editing the cli-template.js file. On line 7, remove the space between "}" and "components". That should solve the problem!

Hope to see you in my next articles!
