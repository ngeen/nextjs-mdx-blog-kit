export const meta = {

Every developer knows that what is the meaning of "Hello world". So that I want to start blogging like that.

In this first article, you can find the heart of this web app. Yes, you didn't hear wrongly, I said web app. Because the webpage which you are reading now is a PWA. So you can get a shortcut of this page to the homepage of your mobile phone and you can look at in offline mode.

You can look at this web app's source code from;
https://github.com/ngeen/nextjs-mdx-blog-kit

This is a modified version of nextjs-mdx-blog-kit project. I added [Bulma](https://bulma.io) Css library, [Devicons](https://konpa.github.io/devicon/) and [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) icon libraries to that project. You can take a look at those libraries by clicking on links. 

And if you need the original project, you can find it from;
https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/nextjs-mdx-blog-kit

When I forked this project from the original there was a little bug about creating a page or post. If the problem continues when you forked from the original you can fix the problem by editing cli-template.js. On line 7, you have to remove space between "}" and "components". It is the cause of the problem.

Hope to see you in the next articles.
